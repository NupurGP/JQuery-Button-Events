I am not sure which node server to use and was not able to load JSON file locally. 
I ran my application using chrome app "Web Server for chrome".
I tried using json-server from cmd and uploaded file on server but it was giving following error:
jquery.min.js:4 XMLHttpRequest cannot load file:///C:/Users/HW1/CHICAGO-STARTUPS.json. Cross origin requests are only supported for protocol schemes: http, data, chrome, chrome-extension, https.
send @ jquery.min.js:4
